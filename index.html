          <h3>Southern Grit Logo Design</h3>
          <img src="/Users/loganAllen/Downloads/Color.png" alt="A clock witht the words Southen Grit above it and a blue paw inside the clock">
          <p>For my first logo project my client wanted a design that really represented what her rescue business was about. She gave me a little bit of discription of what she was looking for and I pieced it all together in a few different styles. The name of her business is Southern Grit, so I wanted to empisize the word grit to bring more meaning to it.  </p>
